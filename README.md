This is a side project I'm working on.

The goal is create a bot that scrapes websites like DoneDeal, Facebook Marketplace etc to find items 
that are listed for a low price which could be resold for profit.

1. Create Working Bot that gets listing from one website
2. Make it go through multiple pages
3. Sort Data by type
4. Compare prices of each item to potential resale value.
